For the program to work, you need to have completed a lecture in [learn.astanait.edu.kz](https://learn.astanait.edu.kz) or an open review of a quiz in Moodle

## Launch

Selenium, OpenPyXL and Tkinter must be installed in your Python environment.

After installing these modules, you can launch QuizizzMaster via main.py using CMD or Terminal.
